# MiniKeepsafe

Small project built with mostly Jetpack components and Retrofit.  

UI is built with Compose and Navigation components

Uses Hilt for DI and has the test harness configured to test JUnit and UI Automation with compose in the future. 

Some experimental libraries used for the sake of fun and excitement

The app's architecture is old school clean MVVM and tries to adhere to SOLID principles.

Lot's of tech debt accrued but the main infrastructure is setup for future repayment of that debt.

No flavors or build configuration was worked on, so running the project should be as simple as letting Android Studio run it in debug.
